# keep Talking and Nobody Explodes manual distributor

This tool takes the Bomb Defusal Manual for Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, and randomly distributes the pages among players.

Obviously, it is infinitely more fun to play the game in person, huddled around a table in a dimly lit room frantically passing manual pages to each other while the person defusing the bomb is hurridly calling out numbers and colors and port configurations. 
However, it's not always possible to gather a group of friends together around a table. 
For that situation we created this tool.

## How to use the tool

1. Think of a fun "password" (this is the seed for the random page selection)
2. Choose how many players there are
3. Choose which player you are
4. Click **Generate**

The tool will generate a PDF file for you which contains all the pages that it chose for you. None of the other players will be able to see these pages.
